PlanarGS combines planar priors from the LP3 pipeline and geometric priors from the pretrained multi-view foundation model with 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-fidelity indoor surface reconstruction from multi-view images. We acheive up to **36.8%** and **43.4%** relative improvements in accuracy on the MuSHRoom and Replica datasets, respectively, with Chamfer distance below **5 cm**. The experiments require one RTX 3090 GPU and take approximately 1 hour to reconstruct a scene.
## Todo List

```
GroundingDINO / Segment Anything dependencies are installed from `pyproject.toml`.  
Please download checkpoints of GroundedSAM from [link1](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
) and [link2](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth), and put them into the `ckpt` folder.
## Dataset Preprocess
We evaluate our method on multi-view images from three indoor datasets:

- [Replica](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset/): We use eight scenes (office0–office4 and room0–room2), sampling 100 views from each scene.

- [ScanNet++](https://scannetpp.mlsg.cit.tum.de/scannetpp/): We select four DSLR-captured sequences: 8b5caf3398, b20a261fdf, 66c98f4a9b, and 88cf747085.

- [MuSHRoom](https://xuqianren.github.io/publications/MuSHRoom/): Our experiments include five iPhone-captured short sequences: coffee_room, classroom, honka, kokko, and vr_room.

We provide all the above above data preprocessed by COLMAP, which can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HsgHZt23ECoug8WTRQVHviGu9h5HgSA9/view?usp=sharing) or the `PlanarGS_dataset` folder of our [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Isabellaxr/PlanarGS_dataset/tree/main). Starting from these data, you can skip the alignment calculation to GT mesh and conveniently evaluate the reconstructed mesh.

**❗Custom Data :** \
If you want to try PlanarGS on other scenes, please use [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) to obtain camera poses and sparse point cloud from multi-view images, and organize the COLMAP results into the **images** and **sparse** directories as shown in our overview of data directory below.
### Generation of Geometric Priors
We use the pre-trained multi-view foundational model [DUSt3R](https://github.com/naver/dust3r) (vendored in the package) to generate geometric priors.  
By default, `--ckpt_mv` uses the Hugging Face model id `naver/DUSt3R_ViTLarge_BaseDecoder_512_dpt`, so a local `.pth` file is not required.
```shell
# data_path represents the path to a scene folder of a dataset.
python run_geomprior.py -s <data_path> --group_size 40 #--vis
```
- If you want to use local DUSt3R weights (offline mode), pass an existing local path via `--ckpt_mv /absolute/path/to/DUSt3R_ViTLarge_BaseDecoder_512_dpt.pth`.
- By default, we sample and extract **40** images per group to run DUSt3R. If your GPU has limited memory (e.g., RTX 3090 with 24GB VRAM), setting `--group_size 25` can help reduce memory usage. However, this may slightly reduce the accuracy of DUSt3R and consequently impact the quality of PlanarGS reconstruction.
- DUSt3R can be swapped out for another multi-view foundation model by replacing the corresponding `./geomprior/run_dust3r.py` implementation.
### Pipeline for Language-prompted planar priors (LP3)
One of the advantages of using the open-vocabulary foundation model is that, for the scene-specific training of PlanarGS, you can freely design **prompts** tailored to the characteristics of each scene, which may further improve the LP3 pipeline and enhance the reconstruction performance of PlanarGS. 
- The prompts provided with the `-t` option below are suitable for most indoor scenes. 
- You may also add or remove prompts according to **the planar objects** present in the scene, especially for planes that appear curved in the reconstructed meshes.
```shell
python run_lp3.py -s <data_path> -t "wall. floor. door. screen. window. ceiling. table" #--vis
```
- GroundedSAM can be swapped out for another vision-language foundation model by replacing the corresponding `./lp3/run_groundedsam.py` implementation.
### Overview of Data Directory
The data directory after preprocession should contain the following components to be complete for training.
```shell
└── <data_path>
    ├── images
    ├── sparse
    │   ├── cameras.bin
    │   ├── images.bin
    │   └── points3D.bin
    ├── geomprior
    │   ├── aligned_depth
    │   ├── resized_confs
    │   ├── prior_normal
    │   └── depth_weights.json
    └── planarprior
        └── mask
```

## Training and Evaluation
Run `train.py` for 30,000 iterations to obtain the Gaussian reconstruction result `point_cloud.ply`. Then run `render.py` to render color images, depth maps, and normal maps from the reconstructed Gaussians, and generate a mesh `tsdf_fusion_post.ply` using the TSDF method. (The meshes can be viewed with [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/)).

- For mesh generation, you can adjust the parameters `--voxel_size` and `--max_depth` according to the scene.
- The `--eval` option splits the scene into training and test sets for novel view synthesis evaluation.

```shell
python train.py -s <data_path> -m <output_path>  #--eval
python render.py -m <output_path> --voxel_size 0.02 --max_depth 100.0  #--eval
```
If you enable `--eval` during training and rendering, you can run `metrics.py` to evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis.
```shell
python metrics.py -m <output_path>
```
### Evaluation of Reconstructed Mesh
We provide a comprehensive evaluation pipeline including **alignment** and **metric calculation**. The evaluation consists of two steps:

#### 1. Alignment Preprocessing

**Quick Start (Pre-computed Alignment):**
For the datasets used in our paper (Replica, ScanNet++, and MuSHRoom), if you start from our COLMAP-processed data, we provide pre-calculated alignment files `align_params.npz` to the GT mesh `mesh.ply`.
1. Download them from the `align_info` folder of our [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Isabellaxr/PlanarGS_dataset/tree/main).
2. Place the `align_params.npz` and `mesh.ply` file into the <data_path> of each scene.
3. **Skip this step** and proceed directly to **Step 2: Metric Calculation**.

**For Custom Data:**
<!-- If you are evaluating on a new scene or a custom dataset, you must run the alignment script to generate `align_params.npz`. This script calculates the coarse alignment (scale & transform) and performs fine-grained ICP registration. -->
If you are evaluating on a new scene or want to run the alignment from scratch, you should have the ground truth
data (including GT mesh, depth maps, and poses) to calculate the scale and coordinate transformation.
- For Replica, ScanNet++, and MuSHRoom, we provide the required GT data structure in the `align_gt` folder of our [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Isabellaxr/PlanarGS_dataset/tree/main). Please download and extract it (e.g., to `align_gt_path`).
- For your own custom dataset, please organize your GT data to match the structure expected by the script (refer to `eval_preprocess.py` for details on required depth/pose files).
- Generate the `align_params.npz` by specifying the `align_gt_path`:
  

```shell
# Available dataset_types: [scannetpp, replica, mushroom]
python eval_preprocess.py -s <data_path> -m <output_path> --dataset_type <dataset_type> --gt_data_path <align_gt_path>
```

#### 2. Metric Calculation

Once aligned, run the evaluation script to compute reconstruction metrics.

**For PlanarGS:**
```shell
python eval_recon.py -s <data_path> -m <output_path>
```

**For Other Methods (e.g., 2DGS, PGSR, DN-Splatter):** 
Our evaluation script supports comparing other methods by specifying the method name and mesh path. Note: For `dn_splatter`, we automatically apply necessary coordinate system fixes.
```
python eval_recon.py -s <data_path> -m <output_path> \
    --method 2dgs \
    --rec_mesh_path /path/to/other/mesh.ply
```
